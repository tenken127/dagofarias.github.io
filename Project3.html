								<h3>Preview</h3>
								<p>The Federal Reserve published its guidance on model risk governance known as SR 11-7 in April 2011, 
									broadly outlining expectations for model validation.  The Fed required predictive models be 
									evaluated on an annual basis and even more frequently if warranted.  While not specified, annual validations 
									for through-the-cycle models require performance testing on out-of-time datasets.   Depository institutions 
									scrambled to standardize procedures, building layers of governance to meet the guidance.  
									However, conservative bank practices after the financial crisis, coupled with the adoption of the Basel II 
									regulations had produced high quality banking books largely devoid of defaults within their middle market portfolios.  
									In addition, non-bank direct lending appears to have taken over most of the middle market, 
									leaving depository institutions with a unique problem.  What happens when you donâ€™t have enough defaults in the banking book to meet SR 11-7 guidance?</p>
