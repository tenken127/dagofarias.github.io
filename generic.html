									My name is Dagoberto Farias and I’m a data scientist with over nine years of model development
									experience in corporate banking and more than 15 years of experience in finance.
									I’m especially interested in navigating the complexities of regulatory requirements and machine learning.
									I transitioned into data science from business analysis for a multi-national bank, taking part in launching
									infrastructure for global regulatory reporting requirements.  I then joined the model development team
									for one of the largest and oldest financial institutions in the world where I acquired subject matter expertise
									in corporate middle market firms with turnover above $10m USD, as well as multi-billion dollar project finance transactions.
									Financial institutions have a long track record of deploying traditional statistical models but regulatory oversight
									within the industry can make machine learning methods challenging to implement. The need for transparency has become
									crucial for regulatory acceptance of ML and that clarity must extend to all internal stakeholders as well.
									This is the area I like to inhabit since I am most comfortable when engaging with stakeholders,
									communicating dense technical information to a non-technical audience and simultanously gaining a better grasp of
									the material as well.
